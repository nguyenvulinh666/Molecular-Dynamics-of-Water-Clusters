<h1> Tutorial for Classical MD </h1>

<h2> General Instructions </h2>


Download DLPOLY.tar from the ftp site and un-tar it to obtain all the material needed
for this exercise. One of the files you should find is "tutorial.html" which you can open for
your own convenience. <br> <br>

<br> <br>

Now we will compile the code. To do this move to the <b> srcmod </b> directory.  

<br> <br>

Type: <b> make clean </b> (to delete any files from old compilations)

<br> <br>

Type: <b> make gfortran </b> (you should see that the different files in that directory are
getting compiled

<br><br>

Once this is successfully completed you should see a DLPOLY.X executable in
the execute directory which is one directory above the current one you are working 
in. Simply do: <b> cd ../execute/ </b> and check to see if there is a DLPOLY.X
executable in there.

<br><br>

We are now almost ready to make the atoms dance!

<br> <br>

After each DLPOLY MD simulation there will be a file called <b> STATIS </b> that contains A LOT
of information on the conserved quantity, temperature, potential energy etc etc

<br> <br>

We will use a small function <b> pickstatis </b> to extract some information from the STATIS file
so that we can plot it in xmgrace.

<br> <br>

Put the information in the pickstatis.txt file into your .bashrc file. Then do 
<b> source .bashrc </b> . Then we run it as: <b> pickstatis 1 < STATIS > output.dat </b>

<br> <br>

<br>

<b> Exercises </b>

In the first exercise we will explore how one chooses the timestep
in an MD simulation. <br> <br>

For all the short exercises to follow, we will use an open source MD
code called DLPOLY. In order to run DLPOLY you will need 3 files namely
CONFIG, CONTROL and FIELD. The CONFIG file contains the atomic coordinates
of the atoms. The CONTROL file contains the parameters needed to run
the molecular dynamics simulation. The FIELD file contains the information
on the forcefield 

<h1> Exercise 1: Choosing the timestep in an MD simulation </h1>
<br> <br>

Choosing the timestep for your MD simulation is a critical part of setting up
the simulation. The rule of thumb is that the timestep should be much smaller than
the fastest frequency in your system.

<br> <br>

Open up the CONTROL file by using your favorite text editor. Type:

<br> <br>

<b> emacs CONTROL & </b>

<br> <br>

In the first two lines you should see: <br> <br>

<b> steps     5000 </b> <br>
<b> timestep  0.005 </b>

<br><br>

This tells DLPOLY that we will run an MD simulation of 5000 steps with a timestep
of 5 femtosecond. In this exercise we will run a simulation
of total length 25 picoseconds, this is because the default unit of time in DLPOLY
is picoseconds. This maybe different for other codes.

<br><br>

Now type the following to run the DLPOLY executable: <br> <br>

<b> Step 1: </b> 

<b> ../dl_poly_2.20/execute/DLPOLY.X  </b> <br><br>

This will run for a couple of seconds and then should generate several files such
as HISTORY, OUTPUT, STATIS. For now we are particularly interested in the STATIS
file. Using the function pickstatis which is located in your .bashrc file, we can
look to see whether the timestep we have chosen is good or not. 

<br> <br>

In an MD simulation, it is always important to check whether the conserved 
quantity is actually conserved. The simulation that you just run is in the
NVT ensemble where the conserved quantity is the sum of the total potential
energy, total kinetic energy and the energy of heat reservoir that controls
the temperature of the system. Lets look at the conserved quantity for the
simulation that you just ran. Type the following:

<b> pickstatis 1 < STATIS > engcons.dat </b>

<br> <br>

Now lets look at the conserved quantity using a plotting program such as xmgrace.
Type: <br> <br>

<b> xmgrace engcons.dat & </b> 

<br> <br>

You should now obtain a plot that looks something like the following: <br> <br>

<p>
<IMG SRC="pics/run2engcons.jpg" WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=592> </p>

<br>

As you can see that there is a significant drift in the first 25 ps and that the
drift is likely to increase even more over a much longer run. Thus the conserved
quantity is <b> not conserved </b>. We are in trouble and need to change
the timestep of our simulation. Lets first save the data we have generated from
this MD simulation for future reference. Lets create a directory called Run1 and move
the some of the data files into that directory. Do the following: <br> <br>

<b> mkdir Run1 </b> <br> <br>

Now do: <br> <br>

<b> mv engcons.dat HISTORY STATIS OUTPUT Run1 <br> <br> </b>

Then we want to cleanup the directory with other files present that aren't needed
at this point. In your bin directory there should be a script that does this. Type
the following: <br> <br>

<b> ~/bin/cleanup.sh </b> 

<br> <br>

Open up the CONTROL file again and change: <br> <br>

dt = 0.005 <br> <br>

to the following:

dr = 0.001 <br> <br>

Now go back to <b> Step 1: </b> above repeating the exercise.

<br> <br>

You should now obtain a plot that looks something like the following: <br> <br>

<IMG SRC="pics/run1engcons.jpg" WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=592>

<br> <br>


<h1> Exercise 2: Thermostating the system to a desired temperature  </h1>
<br> <br>

In this exercise we will try to learn about how we can use thermostats
to control the temperature in a simulation. As you have learnt already, one
can do MD simulations in three ensembles: NVE, NVT and NPT. In this exercise
we will focus on the NVT ensemble (N = number of atoms, V = volume, and T =
temperature). The thermostat that we will use is the Nose-Hoover thermostat
which we have briefly overviewed in the lecture. <br> <br>

Open the CONTROL file again and look for the following two clauses: 

<br><br>

<b> temperature 100 </b> <br>
<b> ensemble nvt hoover 0.2 </b> <br> <br>

The first line tells DLPOLY that we want to do a simulation at 100K. <br><br>

This second line tells the DLPOLY code that we are going to run a simulation in the
NVT ensemble using the Nose-Hoover thermostat with a time constant of 0.2ps. This
time constant dictates how strongly the thermostat is coupled to the the system.
This provides an indirect way to control the temperature of the system. Lets
take a look. <br> <br>

Lets run the DLPOLY code again as we did before using the following: <br> <br>

<b> ../dl_poly_2.20/execute/DLPOLY.X  </b> <br><br>

Once this is finished it will generate the STATIS file as before. Now do the following
to extract the temperature from the runs: <br> <br>

<b> pickstatis 2 < STATIS > engtemp.dat </b> <br> <br>

Now lets plot engtemp.dat using X-Mgrace. As you can see the temperature in
the system fluctuates at around 100K. You should have something that looks
like the following: <br> <br>

<IMG SRC="pics/tempnose1.jpg" WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=592>

<br><br>

Lets now repeat the exercise using the following setting in the CONTROL file: <br> <br>

<b> ensemble nvt hoover 5.0 </b> <br> <br>

Remember to save the old temperature data and also run cleanup.sh. Now lets rerun the
calculation. You should obtain something like the following: <br> <br>

<IMG SRC="pics/nosetemp2.jpg" WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=592>

<br><br>

We see that in this simulation the temperature is not fluctuating around 100K as expected.
This is because the time constant of 5ps is too large. <br> <br>

<h1> Exercise 3: Equilibrating the System  </h1>

In this exercise we will explore how to equilibrate the system being studied with
the MD simulation. It is often the case that when starts an MD simulation the
initial starting configuration is far from equilibrium. In all the previous simulations
the system was close to equilibrium. We will now demonstrate the equilibration of
the system we have been working on, namely the water hexamer. We will first generate
the conditions for the hexamer to be out of equilibrium. This will also expose
you to the use of VMD and periodic boundary conditions (PBC). <br> <br>

Open up the CONTROL file again and set the temperature to 1000K: <br> <br>

<b> temperature 1000 </b> <br>

Run the DLPOLY executable again. This will generate a HISTORY file that we would
like to view later using some visualizing tool such as VMD. Save the HISTORY
file by copying it into another directory. As we will see later, heating the
system up to 1000K evaporates the water cluster as We now want to use the last configuration
generated from the simulation we just ran for the next run. Do the following: <br> <br>

<b> mv REVCON CONFIG </b> <br> <br>

Lets do a cleanup now before we run a new calculation. Now go back to the CONTROL file again 
, set the temperature to 100K, and increase the number of steps to 15000: <br> <br>

<b> steps     5000 </b>
<b> temperature 100 </b>
<br> <br>

An important quantity to check to see if the system has equilibrated is the potential
energy of the system. This quantity should fluctuate around some average value
if the system is equilibrated. Lets examine the potential energy of the system for
the simulation we have just run: <br> <br>

<b> pickstatis 3 < STATIS > engcfg.dat </b> <br> <br>

Now lets plot engcfg using X-MGrace. You should obtain something the following: <br> <br>

<IMG SRC="pics/equil.jpg" WIDTH=692 HEIGHT=692>

<br> <br>

As you can see the potential energy of the system decreases over the course of
the first 10ps. This is an indication that it is equilibrating over this period
of time. This is because the hexamer starts of in an evaporated state of water
and then at 100K the system equilibrates to a state that is favorable at that 
temperature. Shown below is a snapshot of the configuration with periodic images,
at t=0 in the left panel and at t=15ps in the right panel. <br> <br>

<IMG SRC="pics/hexamer.jpg" WIDTH=692 HEIGHT=692>

<br> <br>



<h1> Exercise 4: Computing the radial distribution function (g(r)) from the simulation  </h1>

In this exercise we will examine the radial distribution function of the water cluster
at two different temperatures. Now that you are all familiar with how to run the DLPOLY code
and changing the input parameters in the CONTROL file, I will just refer to previous
exercises for details. Lets first run a simulation of 10000 steps of the water
cluster at 100K. Once the calculation is done you will see that DLPOLY generates
a file called RDFDAT that includes the g(r) for all the atom pairs in the system:
O-O, O-H and H-H. We will focus on the O-O g(r). Open the RDFDAT file and look
for the O-O pair distribution function. Copy the g(r) data for the O-O pair
into a separate data file: 100oogr.dat. Now lets repeat the exercise for
a simulation at 200K. Do the same thing but this time store the g(r) data in another file
called 200oogr.dat. Now lets plot the two g(r)'s at different temperatures on the same
figure. Do you see any differences? When you overlay the g(r)'s obtained at the
lower and higher temperatures you should obtain something like below:

<br> <br>

<IMG SRC="pics/watergr.jpg" WIDTH=692 HEIGHT=692>

<br> <br>

Its worth opening up the trajectories with VMD as well and visualizing what is happening
to the atoms. Try and rationalize what you see in the movies with the information
that you obtain from the g(r). <br> <br>

<h2> Convergence of properties from MD simulation </h2>

An important question that comes up in MD simulation is whether the simulation is long
enough and whether we have enough statistics of the property you are interested in.
One easy check is to take your trajectory and divide it into two blocks: lets
say the first 5ps and the second 5ps. One can then compute the properties for the 
two blocks and compare. For our purposes here since the calculations are cheap,
lets compare the g(r) at 200K for a simulation of length 5ps with one of
length 10ps. Remember to save the RDFDAT file for the two runs separately
so that you can compare the g(r)'s.

<br><br>

The following exercises are for students who may have more experience with MD
simulations and who may want to skip the first three exercises. Also, this maybe
good homework for all the students if we don't have enough time to cover it
during the tutorial.

<h1> Exercise 5: Choosing Ewald Parameters  </h1>

As you learnt before the coulomb interaction between two charges is long range
and hence cannot be treated using a cutoff like we do for the short range van der Waals.
The Colomb sum is calculated using the Ewald Sum which divides the colomb sum into
a short and long range interaction. The short range is treated in real space
while the long range is treated with reciprocal space. In DLPOLY one can
determine the parameters for the Ewald sum manually or set some parameter that
will determine it automatically. We will do this manually as an exercise. There
are three parameters that determine the accuracy of the Ewald sum: the alpha
parameter which determines the Ewald convergence, r_cut which is the real space
cutoff and k_max1, k_max2 and k_max3 which determine the range of the reciprocal
space term. Lets first comment out the flag that automatically determines the
parameters: <br> <br>

<b> #ewald precision 1d-6 </b> <br> <br>

Lets instead a new clause that will allow us to manually determine the correct
ewald parameters: <br> <br>

<b> ewald sum 0.6 10 10 10 </b> <br> <br>

0.6 is the alpha parameter and the three integers (10) define the range of
the reciprocal space term. For this exercise we will just need to do single point
energy calculations: <br> <br>

<br><br>
<b> steps 1 </b> 

<br> <br>
We will now examine the Coulomb energy with the parameters above and then change
the alpha parameter to 0.48 and 0.72. If the parameters are well set the Coulomb energy
should be constant [ there should be a plateau ] across the different alpha values. For
this exercise we can look at the OUTPUT file. Look for the value under eng_cou and you
should see something like -214.31. Lets change alpha to 0.48 and repeat the
single point calculation: we get -209.07 and when we change alpha to 0.72 we get -243.41.
This shows that our Ewald parameters are poorly chosen. Lets now change the parameters to
the following: <br> <br>

<b> ewald sum 0.3 10 10 10 </b> <br> <br>

We now repeat the exercise with alpha 0.3, 0.24 and 0.36. For alpha = 0.3 we get -208.84,
alpha = 0.24 we get -208.84 and similarly for alpha = 0.36 we get -208.84. This result
tells us that our choice of alpha and k_max1, k_max2 and k_max3 are converged. <br> <br>

Lets do one last exercise where we reduce the reciprocal space integers from 10 to
2: <br> <br>

<b> ewald sum 0.3 2 2 2  </b> <br> <br>

The Coulomb energies with alpha = 0.3, 0.24 and 0.36 are: -213.29, -210.60 and finally
-217.88 kJ/mol. This demonstrates again that we need to search for a k_max1, k_max2 and
a k_max3 that lies between 2 and 10. 

<h1> Exercise 6: Computing the dipole moment from classical MD </h1>

In this exercise we will work on computing the dipole moment of a single water
molecule generated from a classical MM force field and see if the 
fluctuations associated with it make sense to you. In this exercise you will
first have to understand how to compute the dipole moment of the a water molecule.
Once you know that, you can sketch out an algorithm on paper and then begin
to implement that in a fortran code. This might be more suited for people with
experience in programming.

<br> <br>

In the Exc6 folder you will find the CONFIG file for a single water.
Lets run a simulation at 100K for 10000 steps. This will generate a HISTORY file.
Lets convert the HISTORY file into an xyz file. This can be done using the hisxyz
executable: <br> <br>

<br> <br>

<b> ./hisxyz </b> <br>

<br> <br>

Follow the instructions inputing HISTORY for the file name, 100 for the
number of configurations and 3 for the number of atoms. This will generate a file
called HIS.xyz. The fortran code that you write should read in the HIS.xyz and
then use that to calculate the dipole moment of the water molecule.

<br> <br>

<h1> Exercise 7: Annealing crystalline silica with Buckingham potential </h1>

<br> <br>

In this exercise we will explore the conversion of crystalline silica into
something mor amorphous and at the same time try to develop an understanding of
the Buckingham potential which is another type of short-range interaction that is
used instead of the Lennard Jones potential - can you rationalize why the Buckingham
potential is perhaps better than the Lennard Jones potential we discussed in class?

<br> <br>

In Exc7 there is the CONFIG, CONTROL and FIELD file as usual for simulating silica
with the Buckingham potential. The idea is to perform 3 simulations in steps. This
means that after each step, you will use the configuration generated at the end of
that run to continue.

<br> <br>

-  A simulation at 500 K for 100 ps.

<br> <br>

-  A simulation at 1000 K for 50 ps.

<br> <br>

-  A simulation at 2000 K for 20 ps

At each stage, look at the quantities like the radial distribution function (Si-O,
O-O etc) and see if you can interpret them and make sense of the results. Also
at each stage look at the quantities like temperature and potential energy. 

<br> <br>

After the 2000K simulation, use the last configuration and start a simulation
at 8000K. Try and visualize this trajectory as well as the potential energy
and temperature.
