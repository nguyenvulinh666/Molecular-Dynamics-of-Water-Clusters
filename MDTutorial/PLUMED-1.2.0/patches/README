Please refer to the manual for a complete guide to installation.

Each of the packages which are compatible with plumed has his own patching script.

DLPOLY 2.20                     : plumedpatch_dlpoly_2.20.sh
ACEMD  1.1                      : plumedpatch_acemd.sh
LAMMPS (downloaded 15 Jan 2010) : plumedpatch_lammps_15-1-2010.sh
Quantum-ESPRESSO 4.1.2          : plumedpatch_qespresso_4.1.2.sh

In the following, we will refer to it as plumedpatch, irrespectively of the code.

At the moment of this release of plumed, only the listed versions of the listed codes
have been tested.

ACEMD USERS: The compilation procedure for ACEMD is slightly different from that of
the other codes. See the complete PLUMED manual.

* TO PATCH

1)  set the plumedir environment variable so that it points to PLUMED root:
(Bourne shell) export plumedir="root_of_plumed_package"
(C shell)      setenv plumedir "root_of_plumed_package"

2)  copy or link the proper plumedpatch file in the root directory of the md code

3a) ONLY SANDER:  Configure the code as usual to produce the config.h (or config_amber.h in AMBER 10) in src/
3b) ONLY GROMACS: Configure the code as usual to produce the Makefile.
3c) ONLY NAMD:    Configure the code as usual.
                  In the plumedpatch script, modify the myarch variable to match your architecture.
3d) ONLY LAMMPS: the directory in which plumedpatch has to be copied is the src directory. Arch should be changed accordingly 
                 to insert the -DLAMMPS_PLUMED define flag. 

4) launch ./plumedpatch -patch

5) compile the md code as usual

* TO UNPATCH

At any time the user may want to ''unpatch'' the MD code and revert back to
the original distribution.
To do so, the user should go to the directory where the plumed patch has been 
copied and type: 

./plumedpatch -revert

* NOTES:
(1) with DLPOLY, using some compilers (.e.g g95) the option -fno-second-underscore
    must be added in the compilation flag to allow the correct linking of C and Fortran routines
(2) with DLPOLY, plumedpatch is also patching the Makefile in the build directory. be sure to use
    the patched ones
