From 1.1 to 1.2
* New Features:
- Compatible with the parallel implementation of AMBER (sander module)
- Adiabatic Biased Molecular Dynamics
- Redesigned Multiple Walkers, more robust on slow filesystems
- Inversion condition to treat CV boundaries
- External fixed potential acting on CVs read from file
- Read and write metadynamics bias from/to file 
- New standalone utility to run PLUMED as an external tool
- Steerplan for complex steered MD simulations
- New format for COLVAR file, including tags, and utilities/plumedat.sh, to parse it
- Option to add a constant force on CVs
- Optimization of code for mean-square-displacement
- Option to use CMAP PATH with PBC

* New Collective Variables:
- Potential energy of the system (only for GROMACS, AMBER and DL_POLY) 
- Similarity to ideal alpha helix and antiparallel/parallel beta sheet structure 
- Number of alpha-helix loops
- Distance from and projection onto a generic axis
- Project a distance along Cartesian axis and planes (contributed by Toni Giorgino)
- Difference between two distances

* Bugs Fixed:
- fixed bug in PUCKERING variable
- fixed bug in BIAS-EXCHANGE + RESTRAINTS
- fixed bug in ALPHABETA restraint
- fixed bug in PATH variables in contact map space
- fixed bug in GROMACS3.3 + parallel tempering or bias-exchange metadynamics
- fixed bug in GRID
- fixed AMBER interface, now supports truncated octahedron periodicity

* New Supported Codes:
- LAMMPS (15 Jan 2010) 
- Quantum-ESPRESSO 4.1.2
- NAMD 2.7b2 
- GROMACS 4.0.7

From 1.0 to 1.1
* Features:
- Compatible with the domain-decomposition parallelization of GROMACS4.
- The bias can be interpolated using cubic splines on a grid
  (accelerates long metadynamics simulations with many hills).
- Sum over hills is parallelized on GROMACS and DLPOLY
  (accelerates long metadynamics simulations with many hills).
- More flexibility in the application of PBC to collective variable
  (useful for intramolecular coordinates).
- New directive ALIGN_ATOMS to work around codes which break molecules (such as GROMACS4 with some setup).
- Redesigned parallel tempering-metadynamics code, less memory required.
- Redesigned parser, with more error checking, plus a few features such as line continuation and NOTE keyword.
- Redesigned patching system, with more error checking.
- Output files are now opened once at the beginning of the simulation (more efficient, especially in replica
  exchange simulations where a huge number of files is opened in the same directory).
- Possibility of switching off metadynamics on a single variable by omitting the SIGMA flag.
- Driver: support to NPT runs with variable cell dimensions; number of CVs is now unlimited; pdb output name has a default when -interval is specified.
- Sum_hills has been parallelized.
* New collective variables:
- Electrostatic potential felt by a atom or group of atoms.
- Puckering variables (thanks to Marcello Sega).
* Bugs fixed:
- Parallel tempering-metadynamics and bias-exchange: fixed bug when using torsional collective variables.
- Fully compatible with particle-decomposition in GROMACS (it is not anymore necessary that all the
  particles involved in metadynamics are assigned to the first node).
- Driver: fixed bug when using a subset of the system atoms in the pdb. 
* Supported codes:
- ACEMD 1.1 added (contributed by Francesco Gervasio)
- NAMD 2.7b1 added
- AMBER 10 added
- DLPOLY 2.20 added
- GROMACS 4.0.5 added
