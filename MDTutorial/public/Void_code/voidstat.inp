input HISTORY file name
formatted or unformatted file
choose configuration from begin to end every interval steps
cutoff radius for candidates
number of species
label and radii of the atoms
If you choose the option 'yes' on the last row an output file with the delaunay tetrahedrons, voronoi vertices
and bottleneck is printed in the voids.trj file

output file:
The file interstices.out contains the void size distribution:
dr = radius of the voids
ri = interstitial statistics 
riw = interstitial statistics without overlaps
rb = bottleneck distribution

The file tdf.out contains the total distribution function of voronoi vertices
