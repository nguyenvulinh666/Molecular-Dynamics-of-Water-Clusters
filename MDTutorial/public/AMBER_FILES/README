Dear Dr. Smith, 

I am sending to you two files which contain force field parameters as
in the 95-96 versions of AMBER (all atom forcefields). Although
nothing is foolproof, I am pretty confident that the numbers in these
files are correct. I did a number of tests to verify them and used
these parameters in a couple of my simulations.  The only difference
from AMBER is that I did not include end residues as in AMBER (they
have slightly different charges). I also did not make any changes
(amb96.dat) in dna/rna units, but kept this section so that dl_poly
utilities could work with these files. I also have a united force
field for DPPC membranes which we used extensively in our
simulations. More details can be found on the following web site:
http://azazello.chem.unc.edu/alex/ff.html. For my simulations I also
modified DL_POLY source code to incorporate the Ryckaert-Bellemans
potential. I would be glad to provide you with the updated versions of
DL_POLY subroutines at your request. I hope that DL_POLY community
would benefit from having updated versions of force field parameter
files.

With best regards,
Alexander Smondyrev.
