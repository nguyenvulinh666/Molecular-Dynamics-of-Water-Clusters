*Final Project in Numerical Methods 2 - CMP 2024 - ICTP*

<h2> Abtract </h2>
Molecular dynamics is the technique that uses the Newtonian mechanics to simulate the movement of atoms and molecules. In this semi-project, we focus on simulating 20 water molecules inside a cubic unit cell with a side length 25\r{A}. Specifically, we examine how radial distribution function, dipole fluctuation and diffusion constant of this system behave under difference temperate at 100 K, 150 K, 200 K and 300 K. Additionally, a comment on how the structural and dielectric properties can be probed experimentally will be given.

<h2> How to use </h2>
- Most of the data wascollected inside the folder HOME/MDTutorial/Exercises/Exc1  <br>
- We use the following bash file to collect the data for analysis: read_OW_data.sh, read_HW_data.sh, compile_different_deltaT.sh and compile_data.sh <br>
- We plot everything in jupyter file RDA_render_data_file_[temp]K, with temp is the particular temperature. <br>
